### Background

### Study design

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "Total number of zoo-reared adult *R. sierrae* released into each of the two study lakes. Note that collect_siteid = 70567 also includes frogs collected from the adjacent 70284, 72458, and 72878."
#| warning: false

tbl_relocate <- read_csv(here("data", "clean", "tbl_relocate.csv"))
knitr::kable(tbl_relocate, align = "c")
```

### Results

For reintroduced versus translocated frogs, the proportion recaptured during subsequent CMR surveys was notably different between the two study lakes.
In 70611, approximately half of translocated and reintroduced frogs were recaptured.
In contrast, in 70413, although approximately half of translocated frogs were recaptured, the proportion of reintroduced frogs that were recaptured was substantially less.

### To do

Create/add figure showing Bd loads of translocated versus reintroduced frogs over time.
2022 load data is currently missing from database.
